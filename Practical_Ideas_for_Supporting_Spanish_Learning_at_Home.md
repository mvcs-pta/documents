MVCS PTA Resource Booklet for Parents
-------------------------------------

Practical Ideas for Supporting Spanish Learning at Home
=======================================================

September 2019

Dear MVCS Families,

We are very happy to provide you with this inaugural edition of the MVCS PTA Resource
Booklet for Parents: Practical Ideas for Supporting Spanish Learning at Home. This year,
Mt. Vernon Community School begins its first year as a fully dual language school.
Understanding the path to language proficiency and supporting your language learner at home
— whether by listening to music or reading or listening to books in Spanish together — are
integral to your child’s success in the dual language program. We hope that the ideas, tips
and resources included in the following pages will be useful to you, wherever your child is in
his or her dual language journey.

Thank you to the parent volunteers who made the publication of this booklet
possible, especially Bonnie Naugle for graphic design, Alix Salinas for research and web
resources and Nora Mead for translation, and to the administration and staff at MVCS,
including Ms. Liza Burrell, Principal, Sofía Meléndez Contreras, Instructional Coach, for
her guidance and to Ms. Jessica Sayler-Quesada, Music Teacher, for her musical
suggestions. We are also thankful to the many parents who took the time to provide thoughts
and suggestions via the parent survey sent home last spring.

We hope to expand on the ideas and tips included in the following pages. Please contact us
with helpful resources you may have for future editions.

Sincerely,

| Martha Davis
| President, MVCS PTA
| 2019-2020

I. Introduction: Why this Resource Booklet?
===========================================

Congratulations on enrolling your child in the MVCS Dual Language (DL) Program!

This resource provides Spanish and English speaking parents tools and ideas to support
your child in the Spanish language and literacy aspect of the MVCS DL program. Within the
ACPS School division, MVCS and John Adams Elementary School (which has a DL strand)
are the only schools in the city with a DL program. Currently, there are many more supports
in place for English learning so we decided that a focus on Spanish made the most sense.

When the PTA talked with and surveyed parents, we learned that a practical resource
like this from parents by parents would be helpful on their elementary school dual
language journey. Parents want to know how to support their children if they do not
speak the language and even when they do, they want practical suggestions.

**About the Dual Language Program and Design**

    The goals of the MVCS Dual Language Program are “for students to listen,
    speak, read and write in Spanish and English; to attain high levels of
    academic and social-emotional competence; and become lifelong
    cross-cultural learners and critical thinkers.”

--`ACPS Dual Language Parent Handbook (p. 1)`

.. _ACPS Dual Language Parent Handbook (p. 1): https://www.acps.k12.va.us/cms/lib/VA01918616/Centricity/Domain/809/dual-language-handbook.pdf

The MVCS program design is considered a 50:50 program model which refers to 50%
Spanish and 50% English. At MVCS, science and math and Spanish language arts are
taught in Spanish for part of the day (Spanish language arts is taught separately in K-2
and integrated into math and science in 3-5), while social studies and English language
arts are taught in the English part of the day with encore subjects (art, music, physical
education and library ) taught primarily in English. Most of the time your child will have
two teachers, one who teaches in Spanish and the other in English. There also may
be times when your child will have only one teacher who teaches in both Spanish and
English and they will follow content and allotment of time in Spanish and English in a
50:50 approach. Note: If your child receives Talented and Gifted Services (TAG), please
see the ACPS website or speak with a school administrator. Students with special needs
are part of the MVCS program.

Please reach out to school administrators for any questions.

In addition, the MVCS program is considered a dual language program, which means
that there are approximately the same number of students who are monolingual or
dominant in English at the time of enrollment as there are students who are
monolingual or dominant in Spanish (or another language) at the time of enrollment. Starting
with the 2019-2020 school year MVCS is a whole school model, which means every
classroom is a dual language classroom.

As a parent of a student in the dual language program in Alexandria, you will want to
understand the pathway or academic progression of students in the DL program.

In the appendices you will find the K-12 Course Progression for Students in the ACPS
Spanish/English Dual language Elementary Program. It describes courses your student
can/will take after elementary school through high school. While currently there is no
ACPS dual language program in middle or high school, Spanish language and literacy
courses are offered specifically for students who have been in the dual language
program. As of the writing of this resource, plans are underway to possibly have a middle
school DL program for students entering 6th grade in 2020-2021, which would mean
adding a content area in Spanish, such as science or social studies, in addition to the
Spanish language and literacy course currently offered. Students from the MVCS DL
program go into a Spanish class for DL students when they enter 6th grade.

**What this resource booklet is not**

This resource booklet does not replace the useful handbook that ACPS put together in
2016 entitled Dual Language Parent Handbook, found on the ACPS website at https://
www.acps.k12.va.us/cms/lib/VA01918616/Centricity/Domain/809/dual-language-hand-
book.pdf. There you will find administrative and research information about an effective
dual language program, which schools offer a DL program, along with other ACPS
information. The handbook provides general information about how your learner may
progress through the stages of second language acquisition, how long it takes to learn
a second language and other Frequently Asked Questions, etc.

This resource booklet is simply a supplementary resource for you to use. Your child’s
teacher is the best source of information for any questions you may have. Information
comes home during the year that provides you with specifics about your child’s
classroom. In addition, in section IV of this booklet MVCS staff have provided useful
information to help you understand the programming and other design aspects of the dual
language program.

**What makes a dual language program a dual language program**

Lastly, it is important to understand the components of a dual language program. As
described in the 2015-2020 ACPS Dual Language Strategic Plan DL non-negotiables
include:

  Dual Language Non-Negotiables
    * A minimum of six year commitment (Grades K-5, and preferably PK-12)
    * A minimum of 50% and up to 90% instruction time in Spanish
    * Strict separation of languages for instruction (no translation) in addition to
      planned opportunities for cross-linguistic transfer
    * Programmatic, curricular, and instructional decisions based on research on
      English learners.

(Beeman & Urow, 2013 adapted from D. Rogers, 2009)

The Center for Applied Linguistics (2012) defines the term dual language program as
“...any program that provides literacy and content instruction to all students through
two languages and that promote bilingualism and biliteracy, grade level academic
achievement, and multicultural competence for all students.”

The best thing you can do to support your child is to get involved: meet other parents,
join the PTA, and one of its committees. There is even a dual language parent
committee that works to support MVCS staff and parents within the school, identifies parent
priorities and represents MVCS at DL events or meetings. In addition, inquire about a
city-wide parent advisory group that includes parents from both MVCS and John Adams
Elementary schools.

II. Basic Primer
================

Regardless of whether you speak Spanish or English it is useful to understand a few
basic things about the similarities and differences between Spanish and English. In the
appendices, you will find the Spanish alphabet and pronunciation guide. While there are
26 letters in the English alphabet there are 27 in the Spanish alphabet, which includes
the same letters as the English alphabet plus “ñ” (spelled “eñe” and pronounced
“EH-nyay”). If you learned Spanish before 1994 you may remember that LL and CH were
considered letters, but the Royal Spanish Academy decided that they should no longer
be included in the Spanish alphabet.

You may also be interested to know that Spanish generally places the adjective after the
noun it describes and that double negatives are used extensively, which is not accepted
in standard English.

**GLAD® Strategies**

MVCS teachers are all trained in Project GLAD® (Guided Language Acquisition Design)
strategies. Project GLAD is a model of professional development and follow up and also
a collection of best practices dedicated to building academic language and literacy for
all students​, especially second language learners. Project GLAD strategies provide ways
for students to:

1. Access grade level academic content and language
2. Engage in a positive classroom environment where they are encouraged to take
   risks

Some of the terms and strategies from Project GLAD include Observation charts, Inquiry
charts, Big Books, Sentence Patterning Charts, Equity sticks, Cognitive Content
Dictionary, Process Grid, chants and more.

**Teachers use GLAD strategies in their work with students.**

What does this look like in the classroom? It looks like a lot of visuals, in the form of
pictures, sketches and motions, to help support student learning. Teachers use charts
that they create with the students so they have ownership of their learning. In class you
will see students repeating, using sentence starters, and talking a lot because the more
students use the language orally the stronger their reading and writing abilities will be.
What does this look like at home? Students may come home singing a chant or song
using the vocabulary they have been working on class. They may process their thinking
with sketches because in class students learn that creating their own visuals can help
them understand what they are reading or what someone is reading aloud to them.
They may also use motions for words which helps them internalize vocabulary. Please
encourage your children to share their learning with you.

**Cognates**

Cognates are words in Spanish and English that share the same Latin, Greek and/
or Arabic root. They have very similar spelling and have the same or similar meaning.
Since they look and mean the same thing it is an easy word to remember. For example,
interesante in Spanish means interesting in English, gratitud in Spanish means the same
as gratitude in English and so on. For more information, this is a good article: https://
www.realfastspanish.com/vocabulary/spanish-cognates

Cognates are helpful and are considered “amigos” for native English speakers learning
Spanish. However, there are also “amigos falsos,” or “false friends,” which look like their
English equivalent, but are not. Some examples include “embarazada,” which means
“pregnant” (not “embarrassed”), and “colegio,” which is an elementary or high school,
not a college.

Here is the visual that teachers use in class to help students understand cognates:

You can go to www.cognates.org or www.Spanishcognates.org for complete lists.

**Spanish Dictionaries:**

You may want to purchase a Spanish dictionary. The second listing was recommended
by several parents.

IV. What You Might Expect from MVCS
===================================

**Summary by Grade (Provided by the MVCS Staff)**

The school communicates through a monthly newsletter by grade about grade specific
information. There is also an MVCS newsletter.

*El Billete.*

Each grade sends out a monthly newsletter summarizing what they will learn for the
month and often includes essential vocabulary in Spanish and English.

*El Mensajo Newsletter (https://www.acps.k12.va.us/Domain/21}*

MVCS’s email newsletter in English and Spanish. You must sign up to subscribe (https://
www.acps.k12.va.us/domain/661). If you prefer not to subscribe, you can read the latest
issues on the MVCS school website (https://www.acps.k12.va.us/Domain/21).

Books in Spanish are sent home weekly. Expect books to come home starting in
October. There are plenty of books in the library in Spanish as well. Ask your
teacher to send books home in Spanish if you do not see them coming home by October.

Starting in the 2019-2020 school year, MVCS will have a school subscription to Reading
A to Z books which allows access to not only teacher materials but many downloadable
and online books in Spanish and English. Ask your teacher for access. You can look at a

Below is a brief description by grade of what students learn and the outline of their day
in Spanish and English. ACPS has two dual language schools, MVCS and John Adams
Elementary School (JAES). We have noted in italics how the 70:30 DL program at JAES
differs from MVCS’s 50:50 model.

**KINDERGARTEN at MVCS**

Kindergartners’ schedules are divided into two. One part of their day is spent learning
language arts, math, and science in Spanish. The other part of the day is spent learning
social studies and literacy in English. A popular part of the day for kindergartners is
calendar. During this time, students engage in math and science activities through
songs and daily routines. All kindergarten units and quarterly assessments for math,
science and literacy are in Spanish. Kindergartners are not required to take state
assessments. Kindergartners at MVCS enjoy field trips, especially to T.C. Williams’ Planetarium.
Homework is not required for kindergartners.

Kindergarten students in the program at JAES spend 70% of the day learning academic
content in Spanish (math, science, social studies and language arts) and 30% of the day
learning academic content in English (English language arts and Encore).

**FIRST GRADE**

First graders’ schedules are divided into two. One part of their day is spent learning
language arts, math, and science in Spanish. The other part of the day is spent learning
social studies and literacy in English. A popular unit for first graders is Exploring Earth
Resources. Through this unit, students learn about conserving resources and caring for
our planet. In first grade, students are assessed in their language of instruction, with
exception of a few math units. First graders are not required to take state assessments.

First graders also enjoy exciting field trips.
First grade students in the JAES program spend 70% of the day learning academic
content in Spanish (math, science, social studies and language arts) and 30% of the day
learning academic content in English (English language arts and Encore).

**SECOND GRADE**

Second graders’ schedules are divided into two. One part of their day is spent learning
language arts, math, and science in Spanish. The other part of the day is spent learning
social studies and literacy in English. A popular event for second graders is their
Economics unit. Students travel around all classes, apply for jobs and run small businesses
where classmates are able to shop. Students are assessed in their language of
instruction, with exception of a few math units. Second graders are not required to take state
assessments. In this grade, students at MVCS enjoy a field trip to the National Museum
of the American Indian.

By second grade, students at JAES transition to Social Studies in English. In second
grade, 50% of the class is taught in English; the other 50% is in Spanish. One part of
their day is spent learning Language Arts, Math, and Science in Spanish. Their second
part of the day is spent learning Social Studies and Literacy in English.

**THIRD GRADE**

Third graders’ schedules are divided into two. One part of their day is spent learning
math and science in Spanish. The other part of the day is spent learning social studies
and literacy in English. A popular third grade activity is learning about simple and
compound machines. Third graders are required to take district benchmark and state
assessments. All district and state assessments are in English. In third grade, State
Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments are given in Reading and Math.

By third grade, equal amounts of instructional time are provided in each language at
JAES.

**FOURTH GRADE**

Fourth graders’ schedules are divided into two. One part of their day is spent learning
math and science in Spanish. The other part of the day is spent learning social studies
and literacy in English. A popular fourth grade activity is learning about the first cultural
contact of American Indians, Africans and Europeans. Fourth graders are required to
take district benchmark and state assessments. All district and state assessments are
in English. In fourth grade, SOL assessments are given in English, Math, and Virginia
History. An exciting field trip for fourth graders is visiting Jamestown.
Fourth grade students at JAES continue to spend equal amounts of instructional time in
each language.

**FIFTH GRADE**

Fifth graders’ schedules are divided into two. One part of their day is spent learning
math and science in Spanish. Their second part of the day is spent learning social
studies and literacy in English. A popular fifth grade activity is investigating about sound and
light waves. Fifth graders are required to take district benchmark and state assessments.
All district and state assessments are in English. In fifth grade, SOL assessments are
given in Reading, Math, and Science. An exciting field trip for MVCS fifth graders is
visiting Georgetown University. A special event in fifth grade is their Promotion Ceremony.
This ceremony celebrates students for culminating their elementary school activities.

Fifth grade students at JAES continue to spend equal amounts of instructional time in
each language.

**HOMEWORK**

Excluding independent reading time, the following guidelines have been established
by the School Board for homework: Grades K – 2: 10-20 minutes, Grades 3 – 5: 30-60
minutes.

**ENCORE**

All grade levels receive Encore classes, which include music, P.E., and art. Students in
Kindergarten through 3rd grade also have library. Because the schedule varies, your
child’s teacher will share his/her schedule during our “Back to School Night.”

**VOLUNTEERS**

Parents are welcome to serve as chaperones on field trips and participate in special
class activities. Please contact the Parent Liaison at MVCS to sign up.


V. What Are Some Resources That I Can Use to Support My Child?
==============================================================

Disclaimer: There are many, many resources available. The resources below are just a
sampling, including ones MVCS parents have recommended. This is a “living
document” and we hope to add/remove information as we discover new resources and we
welcome your suggestions for any additions. See footer for contact information.

This section has various resources (apps, books, games, websites, etc.) that you may find
useful. Many are free and some are available for a fee. The resources below rarely
duplicate resources listed on the ACPS website pages. Some sections begin with an article,
blog or post about the type of resource (books, music, etc.).

It is not necessary to speak Spanish in order to support your child. If you do speak
Spanish at home these other resources are a great way to encourage your child to speak,
listen, read and write in Spanish. It is important to express excitement about your child
becoming a part of a global society and learning another language at such a young
age is a wonderful way to do that. It is also exciting to meet other students who speak
another language and are from different cultures. That is the world they are growing up
in so what better time to start than now!

It is important for your child to read to you or be read to in English and Spanish, every
day if you can manage it. There are websites listed below that have Spanish and English
audio, for example, where you can choose a book, sit with your child, and it will read to
your child in Spanish if you do not speak Spanish.

**OVERALL**

One of the best free one-stop and up-to-date resource is Spanish Mama (https://spanish
mama.com/). This site seems to have everything. This is from the About Me page:

    I’m Elisabeth, the teacher and mother behind Spanish Mama. I actually never expected
    to speak Spanish, teach Spanish, or raise my kids in it. But here I am!

    I struggled in my Spanish classes, back in school. Multilingualism seemed to be for a
    special crowd: people less self-conscious or with a “better ear” for languages. As much as
    I loved the adventure of travel and different cultures, a second language felt out of reach.

    I created this little corner of the internet because life surprised me. I did learn a second
    language, and later, I discovered resources that gave me confidence as a teacher and
    parent. I want my readers to feel the same. You can raise little Spanish-speakers; your
    classroom can be full of living language that sticks!

    You’ll notice I have a little bit of everything. If it feels overwhelming, my start here page
    is a good place to get oriented.

Another good overall site is FLUENTU (https://www.fluentu.com). There are a lot of
Spanish Learner and Spanish Educator blogs that are interesting. There is a fee
associated with this service. An app is also available.

This free website, Unite for Literacy (https://www.uniteforliteracy.com), is a wonderful
resource with a wide selection of books in Spanish and English. There is audio so if you
do not speak Spanish or English the books can be read to your child. You must click on
the English button on the top left to get to the Spanish and then another click once in
the selected book to hear audio in Spanish. The same instructions should be followed
for hearing the book in English once selected.

This free bilingual website, Colorín Colorado (http://www.colorincolorado.org), serves
educators and families in Grades PreK-12. Colorín Colorado provides free research-
based information, activities, and advice to parents and schools.

The free site Newsela (https://newsela.com) offers articles for students to read in
Spanish or English. You need to navigate to click on the correct age, 2nd-5th grade and
whether you would like Spanish (ES) or English. You need to sign up to use the site.

BOOKS
-----

**Books to Borrow**

It is always good to read books that were originally written in Spanish as well as books
that are familiar English titles. You can also take advantage of local libraries. Parents
have reported that both the Duncan Library Branch in Alexandria across from MVCS and
the Shirlington Library Branch (Arlington Public Library) have nice selections of books in
Spanish.

**MVCS Parent Recommendations**

* Books by Liniers (Argentine Cartoonist)
* Chapter books originally in English but translated into Spanish (Junie B. Jones,
  Diary of a Wimpy Kid, etc.) because students are usually familiar with the characters
  and these can be used to understand vocabulary.
* Students can check out books from the MVCS School Library.
* Comic books in Spanish are also available at some libraries.

**Books Available for Purchase**

* Club Leo (Scholastic)
  Scholastic publishes several Spanish language and bilingual books at reasonable

  subscription is purchased.

**A Note about the Spanish Alphabet**

“The Spanish alphabet — by agreement of the 22 member countries of the Association
of Spanish Language Academies on November 28, 2010, at the Guadalajara
International Book Fair — has been changed as follows:

“Ch” and “ll,” which had earlier ceased to be considered letters for purposes of
alphabetization, but had remained letters of the alphabet, are now formally eliminated from
the Spanish alphabet, leaving the Spanish alphabet with just the following 27 letters
(the 26 letters of the English alphabet, plus the letter ñ [spelled “eñe” and pronounced
“EH-nyay”]). These are still taught to students as syllables not as part of the alphabet.

The official Spanish alphabet: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, ñ, o, p, q, r, s, t, u,
v, w, x, y, z.”

Changes to the letter names: As of November 2010 ,28, «W» is now officially called
«doble uve” (although in the past it has also been called “uve doble,” “doble ve,” and
“doble u”), and “Y” is now officially called “ye” (although it has traditionally been called
“i griega” [“Greek i”]). These new official Spanish letter names are considered
recommendations, not requirements (i.e., the traditional letter names are not considered
“wrong”), but the expectation of the Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy,
or RAE) is that teachers will teach the official version which, in the RAE›s view, should
make things simpler for students of Spanish, especially because each letter will now
have just one, unique name, and that name will be the same in every Spanish-speaking
country.”
